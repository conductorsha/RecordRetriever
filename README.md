# Record Retriever

This repository has been created to give an ability to mock and work with data that cannot be inserted with DML. Such as: CustomMetadata, NetworkMembers.

Also, this fremework allows you to mock any data, manipulate the data retrieval by logic condition and limit the number of overall DMLs inside your test classes.
